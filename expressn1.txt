Express is a web application framework for Node
 Its built on top of Node.js.
 It provides various features that make web application development fast and easy
compared to Node.js.
• Create a new folder: eg E:\Express-app
• E:\Express-app>npm init //for creating package.json
• E:\Express-app>npm install express --save 

Routes:
The path is a string or regular expression representing the URL that the route
responds to.
 Note that the query string is not considered part of the route’s URL. 

Express also augments the request and response objects with additional
methods. Example response.send() .
 send() is used to send a response status code and/or body back to the client.
 If the first argument to send() is a number, then it is treated as the status code. If a
status code is not provided, Express will send back a 200.
 The response body can be specified in the first or second argument, and can be a string,
Buffer, array, or object.



var express = require("express");
var app = express();
var path = require('path');
app.get("/buff", function(req, res, next) {
 var buff = Buffer.from("Hello World");
 res.send(buff.toString());
});
app.get("/string", function(req, res, next) {
 res.send("Hello <strong>String response</strong>");
});
app.get("/json", function(req, res, next) {
 res.send({name:'Soha',age:23});
});
app.get("/array", function(req, res, next) {
 res.send(['NodeJS','Angular','ExpressJS']);
});
app.get("/file", function(req, res, next) {
 res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname + '/summer.html'));
});
app.listen(3000);

req.params - An object containing parameter values parsed from the URL path.
 For example, if you have the route /user/:name, then the “name” property is available
as req.params.name. This object defaults to {}.


• To handle HTTP POST request in Express.js version 4 and above, you need
to install a middleware module called body-parser. 
This body-parser module parses the JSON, buffer, string and url encoded data
submitted using HTTP POST request.
 Eg :To parse json data: app.use(bodyParser.json())

 Routes HTTP GET requests to the specified path with the specified callback
functions. Callback functions can be:
o A middleware function.
o A series of middleware functions (separated by commas).
o An array of middleware functions. 


A template engine facilitates you to use static template files in your applications.
 At runtime, it replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the
template into an HTML file sent to the client.
 This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page.
 Some popular template engines that work with Express are Pug, Mustache, Haml,
Hogan, Swig and EJS. 



Rendering and RedirectingEdit
There is an important difference between render and redirect_to: render will tell Rails what view it should use (with the same parameters you may have already sent) but redirect_to sends a new request to the browser.
